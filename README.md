The ARTIC-R2 is an integrated low power small size ARGOS 2/3/4 single chip radio. ARTIC-R2 implements a message based wireless interface. For satellite uplink communication, ARTIC-R2 will encode, modulate and transmit provided user messages. For downlink communication, ARTIC-R2 will lock to the downstream, demodulate and decode it and extract the satellite messages.

The ARTIC-R2 can transmit signals in frequency bands around 400MHz and receive signals in the bands around 466MHz, in accordance with the ARGOS satellite system specifications. The ARTIC-R2 is compliant to all ARGOS 3 and ARGOS 4 RX and TX standards. It contains a RF transceiver and frequency synthesizer and a digital baseband modem. The ARTIC-R2 contains an on-chip power amplifier delivering 1mW [0dBm] output power, that serves as an output for connecting an external high efficient PA. The (de)modulation algorithms run on an on-chip DSP. This software approach allows for retargeting the ARTIC for other applications. The DSP program can be retained on an external flash or the MCU.

- Serial interface (SPI) for communication with MCU
- Programmable DSP core on board to ensure flexibility
- RX frequency : 466MHz â€“ TX frequency: 400MHz
- Fractional N frequency synthesis
- Supported TX standards:
  - BPSK: PTT-A2 (ARGOS 2), PTT-VLD (ARGOS 4)
  - QPSK: PTT-A3, PTT-ZE (ARGOS 3)
  - GMSK: PTT-HD (ARGOS 3), PTT-MD (ARGOS 4), PTT-HD (ARGOS 4)
- Supported RX standards:
  - BPSK: PMT-A3 (ARGOS 3)
  - DSSS OQPSK: PMT-A4 (ARGOS 4) not available
- Dedicated flash Interface to retain Firmware
- Support COSPAS-SARSAT standard
- Operates on external 26MHz reference clock
- Dual supply, 1.8V and 3.3V
- Integrated PA (0dBm) to combine with external PA

An RFPA0133 programmable gain power amplifier boosts the 0dBm (1mW) output from the ARTIC by up to 26dB, producing a maximum transmit power level of 400mW. The transmit power can be adjusted via the **G8** pad.

The ARGOS satellite system is restricted to specific programs and applications. Please check that your project meets these requirements before buying hardware. [CLS (France)](https://www.cls-telemetry.com/argos-solutions/) and the [Woods Hole Group (America)](https://www.clsamerica.com/science-with-argos) will be able to advise if your project meets the requirements.

## Pads

Starting Top Left, going Counter-Clockwise:

| Pad | Name | I/O | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **G8** | INPUT | Pull up to 3.3V to set the RFPA0133 transmit power to maximum. The transmit power will be reduced by _approximately_ 5dB if this pin is pulled low or left open. |
| **2** | **3.0V** | OUTPUT | This pad allows measurement of the module's internal 3.0V rail. |
| **3** | **BOOT** | INPUT | Connected to the ARTIC BOOT pin. Pulled up to 3.3V via a 100k resistor. When high, the ARTIC boots from the external flash memory. Pull low if the ARTIC firmware will be downloaded by the MCU via SPI. |
| **4** | **INT1** | OUTPUT | Connected to the ARTIC INT1 pin. Will be pulled up to 3.3V by the ARTIC to indicate (e.g.) an RX_VALID_MESSAGE. |
| **5** | **INT2** | OUTPUT | Connected to the ARTIC INT2 pin. Will be pulled up to 3.3V by the ARTIC to indicate (e.g.) an RX_BUFFER_OVERFLOW. |
| **6** | **RESETB** | INPUT | Connected to the ARTIC reset pin. Pulled up to 3.3V via a 100k resistor. Pull low to reset the ARTIC. |
| **7** | **CS** | INPUT | SPI interface Chip Select. 3.3V. Active low. |
| **8** | **SCLK** | INPUT | SPI interface clock signal. Typically 1MHz. 3.3V. See the ARTIC R2 datasheet for the permitted clock speeds. |
| **9** | **COPI** | INPUT | SPI interface: Controller Out Peripheral In. 3.3V. |
| **10** | **CIPO** | OUTPUT | SPI interface: Controller In Peripheral Out. 3.3V. |
| **11** | **1.8V** | OUTPUT | This pad allows measurement of the module's internal 1.8V rail. |
| **12** | **GND** | | Power ground / 0V. |
| **13** | **GND** | | Power ground / 0V. |
| **14** | **VIN** | INPUT | 3.3V power supply for the module. **Voltage must be: 3.3V +/- 0.1V**. Current limit: 500mA. |
| **15** | **PWR EN** | INPUT | Pulled low via a 10k resistor. Pull up to 3.3V to enable power for the ARTIC R2. |
| **16** | **FLASH_PWR** | INPUT | 3.3V power supply for the internal flash memory. **Connect to Pin 17 (3.3V)**. |
| **17** | **3.3V** | OUTPUT | Connected to the module's internal 3.3V rail (switched) and provides power for the internal flash memory. **Connect to Pin 16 (FLASH_PWR)**. |
| **18** | **FLSH_SCLK** | | Clock signal for the internal SST25VF020B 2-Mbit SPI Serial Flash. Used when programming the internal flash memory. **Leave unconnected**. |
| **19** | **FLSH_SI** | | Serial Data In for internal SST25VF020B 2-Mbit SPI Serial Flash. Used when programming the internal flash memory. **Leave unconnected**. |
| **20** | **FLSH_SO** | | Serial Data Out for internal SST25VF020B 2-Mbit SPI Serial Flash. Used when programming the internal flash memory. **Leave unconnected**. |
| **21** | **FLSH_CEN** | | Chip Enable for internal SST25VF020B 2-Mbit SPI Serial Flash. Used when programming the internal flash memory. **Leave unconnected**. |
| **22** | **GND** | | Power ground / 0V. |
| **23** | **ANTENNA** | RF | Antenna connection (50 Ohm). Connected internally to the center pin of the u.FL connector. |
| **24** | **GND** | | Power ground / 0V. |

The full schematic for IOTA is available [here](./Hardware/Schematic.pdf).

## Antenna

The antenna is connected via a uFL connector or the Antenna pad. A 400MHz quarter wave wire antenna is all that is required for most applications.

**Always ensure an antenna is attached to the transceiver shield. (Never attempt to transmit without an antenna attached! Doing so can damage the RF amplifier.)**

## Arduino Library

The [SparkFun ARGOS ARTIC R2 Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ARGOS_ARTIC_R2_Arduino_Library) contains a full set of examples
to get you up and running with IOTA. Simply uncomment the _**#define IOTA**_, change the pins numbers if you need to, and away you go!
